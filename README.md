Final TOP HTML Project

I'm excited to start this project
I will pause it today with my first COMMIT (2/24/24)
I will resume the project and hopefully complete it tomorrow 

This project will showcase all the skills I have learned thus far about the:
COMMAND LINE
VSCode editor
GIT HUB
HTML Coding Basics

This file will update with specifics as I complete the project

I was able to use the COMMAND line to copy all course html documents and then simply adjust the text to reflect the proper location of the files and directories the program needed to flow

I was also able to convert files from my phone and convert them to .jpg files and use them as real life images on the mock web page

I started to think about formating text making things bold and such but realized when I started that maybe I should just focus on the assignment and hold off on the super detail orients. There will be time to be detail oriented later.
LET'S GO!
